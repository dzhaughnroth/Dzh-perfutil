<h1>LogHistograms: A scalable data structure for gathering performance data.</h1>

When gathering performance data, there are two common approaches:
<ul>
<li>Log individual events. This is a rich set of information, but the approach does not scale 
beyond a modest set of metrics, because it consumes resources at a rate proportional 
to the number of events being recorded.</li>
<li>Periodically log statistics, say every minute. It scales just fine. However, 
statistical data does not aggregate well; in particular, knowing the 95th percentile 
over each minute does not tell you much about the 95th percentile for a given hour. 
Likewise, knowing the 95th percentile of a bank of 100 servers behind a load balancer 
does not tell you much about the 95th percentile of the application overall. And none 
of this tell you anything about, say, 99.9th percentile, unless you had the foresight 
to instrument that, too. And what about the 99.999th?</li> 
</ul>

<p>The LogHistogram is a data structure aimed at a middle ground between these two. While
having resource usage whose size bounded independently of the number of events recorded, 
it keeps enough information to estimate any quantile value after the fact, and to be able to 
aggregate similar data structures. The estimate is within 10% of its actual value; it is
10% whether the value is .0000001 or 100000, and the estimate remains within 10% over any
aggregation.</p>

<p>The data structure is trivial: it is just a histogram with buckets representing ranges
of values that increase exponentially. Aggregation of histograms is simply adding the counts
of corresponding buckets.</p>

<p>This code base contains the data structure and some simple utilities for accumulating and
logging the data. The serialization consists of messages formatted in JSON. LogHistogramCalculator
does the basic computation, but richer analysis tools will be available in a companion project.</p>
